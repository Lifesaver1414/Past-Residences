# Crib One
  <body> I have many cribs. One is in Revendell! The place of the Elves. Only problem is the increase in orcs, place is going down. Revenue went downn after Sauron came. </body>

# Crib Two
  <body> So get this, your not going to believe it. I walked into this town one day, "The Shire," and decided "Im going to take someones house," and I did. Tricked a hobbit into coming on a quest with me, "We need a theif," I told him. So he took the deed and everything he had, and came with me. Unknowest that I took the deed in his sleep.....guess who's the better theif......The view is amazing.....

# Crib Three
  <body> What an amazing castle. I came here because of the beautiful plains, the great sky, and the people are just great. Gondor even have this amazing tree on top of the foundation. But the king at the time sucked. Nice white walls. Everybody in this photo dies.
